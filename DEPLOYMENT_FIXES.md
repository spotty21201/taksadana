# Vercel Deployment Fixes

## Problem
The original Vercel deployment failed with the error:
```
sh: line 1: prisma: command not found
Error: Command "npm install && prisma generate" exited with 127
```

## Root Cause
Vercel was trying to run `prisma generate` as part of the install command, but the Prisma CLI was not available in the build environment.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created vercel.json Configuration
Created a `vercel.json` file with proper build configuration:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "prisma generate && next build",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "file:./dev.db"
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated package.json Build Script
Modified the build script in `package.json` to include Prisma generation:
```json
"build": "prisma generate && next build"
```

### 3. Fixed Environment Variables
- Updated `.env` file to use a relative path: `DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db`
- Created `.env.example` file for documentation
- Ensured the database URL works in Vercel's environment

### 4. Fixed ESLint Warning
Removed unused eslint-disable directive in `src/hooks/use-toast.ts` to ensure clean build.

### 5. Updated Documentation
Added comprehensive Vercel deployment instructions to `README.md` including:
- Step-by-step deployment process
- Required environment variables
- Troubleshooting guide

## Deployment Process

### For Vercel Deployment:
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Set environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db`
   - `ZAI_API_KEY=your_zai_api_key_here`
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_here`
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app`
4. Deploy - Vercel will automatically handle Prisma generation

### Key Changes:
- **vercel.json**: Proper build configuration
- **package.json**: Updated build script
- **.env**: Fixed database URL path
- **README.md**: Added deployment documentation
- **DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md**: This documentation file

## Result
The project is now properly configured for Vercel deployment with automatic Prisma client generation during the build process.
